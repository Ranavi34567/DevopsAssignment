# DevOps Assignment Readme

## Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to demonstrate your basic ability to work with simple Docker features.

## Deadline:
You have 3 days to complete this assignment.

## Task Details:
### Step 1:
Download the assignment files from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12gZcH1Jr1xWWRzyH3yMqJ9DV_3rlHsnK/view?usp=sharing).
The assignment includes two files:
1. `main.js` - A simple Node/Express REST API that returns a "Hello, World!" response on port 3000.
2. `package.json` - Dependency management file.

### Step 2:
Check if Node.js is installed on your computer. If not, then install it.

### Step 3:
Run `npm install`. This will generate `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` files.

### Step 4:
Run `node main.js`. This will start the API, which can be accessed at http://localhost:3000, and you will see the response "Hello, World!".

### Step 5:
Create a `Dockerfile` to build an image of the above code.

### Step 6:
Run a Docker container using the created image. Don't forget to expose the required port(s).

### Step 7:
Access the API, and you should see the response "Hello, World!".

### BONUS:
Write a `docker-compose.yml` file and use `docker-compose` to complete the assignment.

### Submission:
Once the assignment has been completed, push it to GitHub and share the repository link with us.

## Additional Notes:
- You can install Docker on your system and complete the assignment locally, or you can use an online Docker Playground such as [https://labs.play-with-docker.com](https://labs.play-with-docker.com).
- Make sure to follow the steps carefully and complete all the required tasks within the given deadline.

Good luck with the assignment! If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.
